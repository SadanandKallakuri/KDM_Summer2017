new
anarchism
as
a
term
of
abuse
first
used
against
early
working
class
radicals
including
the
diggers
of
the
english
revolution
and
the
sans
culottes
of
the
french
revolution
whilst
the
term
is
still
used
in
a
pejorative
way
to
describe
any
act
that
used
violent
means
to
destroy
the
organization
of
society
it
has
also
been
taken
up
as
a
positive
label
by
self
defined
anarchists
the
word
anarchism
is
derived
from
the
greek
without
archons
ruler
chief
king
anarchism
as
a
political
philosophy
is
the
belief
that
rulers
are
unnecessary
and
should
be
abolished
although
there
are
differing
interpretations
of
what
this
means
anarchism
also
refers
to
related
social
movements
that
advocate
the
elimination
of
authoritarian
institutions
particularly
the
state
the
word
anarchy
as
most
anarchists
use
it
does
not
imply
chaos
nihilism
or
anomie
but
rather
a
harmonious
anti
authoritarian
society
in
place
of
what
are
regarded
as
authoritarian
political
structures
and
coercive
economic
institutions
anarchists
advocate
social
relations
based
upon
voluntary
association
of
autonomous
individuals
mutual
aid
and
self
governance
while
anarchism
is
most
easily
defined
by
what
it
is
against
anarchists
also
offer
positive
visions
of
what
they
believe
to
be
a
truly
free
society
however
ideas
about
how
an
anarchist
society
might
work
vary
considerably
especially
with
respect
to
economics
there
is
also
disagreement
about
how
a
free
society
might
be
brought
about
origins
and
predecessors
kropotkin
and
others
argue
that
before
recorded
history
human
society
was
organized
on
anarchist
principles
most
anthropologists
follow
kropotkin
and
engels
in
believing
that
hunter
gatherer
bands
were
egalitarian
and
lacked
division
of
labour
accumulated
wealth
or
decreed
law
and
had
equal
access
to
resources
william
godwin
anarchists
including
the
the
anarchy
organisation
and
rothbard
find
anarchist
attitudes
in
taoism
from
ancient
china
kropotkin
found
similar
ideas
in
stoic
zeno
of
citium
according
to
kropotkin
zeno
repudiated
the
omnipotence
of
the
state
its
intervention
and
regimentation
and
proclaimed
the
sovereignty
of
the
moral
law
of
the
individual
the
anabaptists
of
one
six
th
century
europe
are
sometimes
considered
to
be
religious
forerunners
of
modern
anarchism
bertrand
russell
in
his
history
of
western
philosophy
writes
that
the
anabaptists
repudiated
all
law
since
they
held
that
the
good
man
will
be
guided
at
every
moment
by
the
holy
spirit
from
this
premise
they
arrive
at
communism
the
diggers
or
true
levellers
were
an
early
communistic
movement
during
the
time
of
the
english
civil
war
and
are
considered
by
some
as
forerunners
of
modern
anarchism
in
the
modern
era
the
first
to
use
the
term
to
mean
something
other
than
chaos
was
louis
armand
baron
de
lahontan
in
his
nouveaux
voyages
dans
l
am
rique
septentrionale
one
seven
zero
three
where
he
described
the
indigenous
american
society
which
had
no
state
laws
prisons
priests
or
private
property
as
being
in
anarchy
russell
means
a
libertarian
and
leader
in
the
american
indian
movement
has
repeatedly
stated
that
he
is
an
anarchist
and
so
are
all
his
ancestors
in
one
seven
nine
three
in
the
thick
of
the
french
revolution
william
godwin
published
an
enquiry
concerning
political
justice
although
godwin
did
not
use
the
word
anarchism
many
later
anarchists
have
regarded
this
book
as
the
first
major
anarchist
text
and
godwin
as
the
founder
of
philosophical
anarchism
but
at
this
point
no
anarchist
movement
yet
existed
and
the
term
anarchiste
was
known
mainly
as
an
insult
hurled
by
the
bourgeois
girondins
at
more
radical
elements
in
the
french
revolution
the
first
self
labelled
anarchist
pierre
joseph
proudhon
it
is
commonly
held
that
it
wasn
t
until
pierre
joseph
proudhon
published
what
is
property
in
one
eight
four
zero
that
the
term
anarchist
was
adopted
as
a
self
description
it
is
for
this
reason
that
some
claim
proudhon
as
the
founder
of
modern
anarchist
theory
in
what
is
property
proudhon
answers
with
the
famous
accusation
property
is
theft
in
this
work
he
opposed
the
institution
of
decreed
property
propri
t
where
owners
have
complete
rights
to
use
and
abuse
their
property
as
they
wish
such
as
exploiting
workers
for
profit
in
its
place
proudhon
supported
what
he
called
possession
individuals
can
have
limited
rights
to
use
resources
capital
and
goods
in
accordance
with
principles
of
equality
and
justice
proudhon
s
vision
of
anarchy
which
he
called
mutualism
mutuellisme
involved
an
exchange
economy
where
individuals
and
groups
could
trade
the
products
of
their
labor
using
labor
notes
which
represented
the
amount
of
working
time
involved
in
production
this
would
ensure
that
no
one
would
profit
from
the
labor
of
others
workers
could
freely
join
together
in
co
operative
workshops
an
interest
free
bank
would
be
set
up
to
provide
everyone
with
access
to
the
means
of
production
proudhon
s
ideas
were
influential
within
french
working
class
movements
and
his
followers
were
active
in
the
revolution
of
one
eight
four
eight
in
france
proudhon
s
philosophy
of
property
is
complex
it
was
developed
in
a
number
of
works
over
his
lifetime
and
there
are
differing
interpretations
of
some
of
his
ideas
for
more
detailed
discussion
see
here
max
stirner
s
egoism
in
his
the
ego
and
its
own
stirner
argued
that
most
commonly
accepted
social
institutions
including
the
notion
of
state
property
as
a
right
natural
rights
in
general
and
the
very
notion
of
society
were
mere
illusions
or
ghosts
in
the
mind
saying
of
society
that
the
individuals
are
its
reality
he
advocated
egoism
and
a
form
of
amoralism
in
which
individuals
would
unite
in
associations
of
egoists
only
when
it
was
in
their
self
interest
to
do
so
for
him
property
simply
comes
about
through
might
whoever
knows
how
to
take
to
defend
the
thing
to
him
belongs
property
and
what
i
have
in
my
power
that
is
my
own
so
long
as
i
assert
myself
as
holder
i
am
the
proprietor
of
the
thing
stirner
never
called
himself
an
anarchist
he
accepted
only
the
label
egoist
nevertheless
his
ideas
were
influential
on
many
individualistically
inclined
anarchists
although
interpretations
of
his
thought
are
diverse
