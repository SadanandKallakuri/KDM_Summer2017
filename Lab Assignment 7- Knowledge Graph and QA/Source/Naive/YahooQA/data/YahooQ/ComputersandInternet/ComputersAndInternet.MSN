possible hotmail e mail hacking i have an e mail account with hotmail which i seldom use probably once or twice in a year i logged in yesterday to find out a myspace account i knew nouthing about had been made using the e mail account i was able to log in to the myspace and delete it and found out the person that set up the account had tried to change the log in e mail to a yahoo co uk account has the hotmail email account been hacked in to and if so what should i do with the account whoever set up the myspace was somehow able to get to get in the e mail to verify the myspace and has used the e mail on the yahoo chat site as an msn messenger address it sounds possible that someone has hacked the email account your best bet is to log onto passport com type in and change your password make the password a strong one use underscores or other symbols in the password to make it more impossible for someone to attempt to hack the account again it is very simple and very quick but also make sure that you also change your secret question and answer too at the same time because they have the information to possibly re set your password again if they cannot get into the account need further assistance contact msn support they can help you with all of these things i can also help you if you want to as well find me on tosserchops and leave me an offliner ok good luck  Hotmail Gmail Cross site scripting MSN E-mail spam E-mail Opera (web browser) RuneScape cheats Internet fraud Phishing Webmail Stopping e-mail abuse AOL Instant Messenger Miranda IM Danger Hiptop Password cracking Viral marketing Sender Policy Framework Advance fee fraud Google Internet Relay Chat Google Talk Yahoo!
