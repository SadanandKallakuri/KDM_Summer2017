iq score so i just took an iq test i'm and my score was i'm just curious as to where on the scale that is they didn't really give you anything that said you're above average or below average or anything so i'm just wondering whether that's good or not no my iq test wasn't scaled for a year old it was just a regular adult one iq is your mental age divided by your chronological age and then multiplied by so if your mind is years old and your body is only years old your iq is was your test scaled for a year old if it was then your iq is average for everyone is about give or take a few points if your test wasn't scaled for a year old then it was most likely an adult iq test people are generally considered to have achieved their full intelligence at age you never stop learning but your ability to learn is thought to stop growing at so if it was an adult iq test your true score was which is outstanding about of all people have iqs between and and over of all people have iqs between and so you can get a feel for how you scored from that  Intelligence quotient Marilyn vos Savant Mental retardation Grade (education) SAT Sex and intelligence IQ and the Wealth of Nations Race and intelligence Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Controversies in autism Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Item response theory Collective intelligence GED Asperger syndrome Theory of multiple intelligences General intelligence factor Artificial consciousness Affirmative action Milton H.
