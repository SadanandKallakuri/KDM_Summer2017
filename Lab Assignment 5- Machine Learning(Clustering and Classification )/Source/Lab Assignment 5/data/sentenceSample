You are in an environment right now.
It is anywhere you are.
Your home, place of work, and classroom where you study are all environments.
Is your environment healthy?
Pollution can be found anywhere.
Pollution is bad for your health.
Garbage, dust, dirt and mold are bad for your health.
They can all cause sickness and allergies.
They can also attract pests.
There are two good ways to keep your environment healthy.
First, keep it clean.
Second, don’t pollute.
Clean your home every week.
Get the whole family involved.
Assign each person a task.
Keep your kitchen and bathrooms clean.
Mold and germs can form very easily in those two rooms.
Keep food off the floor and sweep often.
Wash dirty dishes daily.
Wear rubber gloves when using cleaning products.
Some products contain chemicals.
Keep cleaning products away from children.
Many products are poisonous.
Find a high, safe place to store cleaning products.
Help keep your children’s school or a nearby park clean.
Recycle cans, bottles and paper.
Pick up trash and ask others to do the same.
Don’t litter.
Make sure to throw your own trash in garbage cans.
Children are always watching and learning from their parents and other adults.
We need to model good environmental health.
