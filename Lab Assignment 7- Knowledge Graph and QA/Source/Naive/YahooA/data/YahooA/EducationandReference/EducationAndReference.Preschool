what can i do concerning my yr old son's school here in ontario he was diagnosed almost a year ago of diabetes insulin depandant but doesn't need insulin during school so far my yr old daughter is starting kindergarten half days last yr went to his school daily at his lunchtime to give him his lunchtime blood sugar test which is only a prick in the finger of course i was willing to do it anyways the school does not want to do his blood sugar test and my daughter will be starting junior kindergarten which is half days so it will be pretty busy any good suggestions of how i can get the school to do an easy blood sugar test to my son any help would be very much appreciated thanku i'm going to assume that like many schools his school does not have a nurse who have you talked to principal his new teacher the school secretary i'll assume you've talked to all of them if not ask to have a meeting before school starts to discuss the blood sugar test they probably don't want to take on the responsibility what if they misread the test cause an infection do it wrong probably all kinds of scenarios running through their minds i don't see how it would be any different than giving prescription medication maybe if you have a letter from the doctor and tell them you will train your child and school personnel in how to administer the test it's possible there's something in your school or school district policies that forbids it but i don't know have you ever gone to www todaysparent com try asking in the parenting forums there i know there are parents there who have children with diabetes and are also from ontario or at least from canada they might've run into the same situation i'd try posting in general ed and families with special needs maybe even kids health and safety introduce yourself in community chat and ask people to check out your post in the appropriate forum good luck  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Hypoglycemia Insulin resistance Hyperglycemia Medicine Prostate cancer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Insulin Education in the United States Growth hormone treatment Medical prescription Nurse Glucose meter Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Kindergarten Gastroparesis Education in the People's Republic of China Childbirth Alzheimer's disease Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Physician Atkins Nutritional Approach Ben Johnson (athlete) Terri Schiavo Clinical depression Polycystic ovary syndrome Medicare (Canada) Ferret National Institutes of Health Intensive insulinotherapy Breastfeeding First aid Blood donation Obstetrics Social rule Dentistry Glycogen storage disease type I HIV test Folic acid Soft drink Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Autism Urinary incontinence Frederick Banting Food and Drug Administration Post-traumatic stress disorder Milton H.

explain why a naughty or time out chair is not appropriate as positive discipline strategy guiding behaviour i was asked to explain why a time out chaire is not appripriate and is in fact not recommended for use in a child care setting in canada as a positive discipline strategy instead my submitted a how to guide to using time out just to clarify the time out chair is used in canadian preschools however the time to be alloted for the child during time out should not exceed his her age for example a child who is three should not be on the time out chair for more that minutes this strategy is more of a negative reinforcement because sitting away from his her friends is not an enjoyable feeling isolating the child should be done immediately after an undesirable action but there should be an adult to explain to the child why he she will be isolated time out gives the child a moment to think and reflect about his her actions however if there is no explanation given to the child about his her punishment the child might not be able to see what his her time out is for a time out is truly a negative reinforcement it is a punishment given after an unacceptable behavior examples of positive reinforcements telling the child that you will give him her a good mark stamp or star or sticker or a reward present if he she finishes his her work or is he she does not bite a classmate whatever behavior is being avoided for that day giving a hug or simply a high five when he she does something positively expressing your own feelings for example a child hit a classmate the teacher can say to the child do you think that is nice i felt sad when you hit name of the classmate do you like me to be sad you know what i think i will be really happy if you hug him her instead of hitting and then show the child how to hug and say sorry to the classmate he she hit there are so many ways to reinforce children sometimes it's for the teacher to find out ways and means to discipline them  Spanking Infantilism Theory of conduct Happiness Motivation Nicomachean Ethics Punishment Reinforcement Transactional analysis Social psychology Alexander Technique Second language acquisition Prisoner's dilemma __mile Durkheim Avenue Q Efficiency wages Past teachings of Prem Rawat Dog training Physical intimacy Ludwig Wittgenstein Altruism Graduate school Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Child time-out Transsexuality Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Microeconomics Empathy Hikikomori Education in Japan Shaggy dog story Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus School discipline Poker jargon Economics Sexual orientation Behaviorism Addiction Burrhus Frederic Skinner Singlish Columbine High School massacre Milton H.

abeka vs theme curriculum for pre k my daughter has been in preschool since age with the theme curriculum and has done well for this upcoming school year the preschool her pre k year is offering either abeka or theme curriculum what are your thoughts on either what type child does well in each curriculum any help would be great thanks lb my son is going to take abeka course this year at a private preschool ironically i teach public preschool with a thematic curriculum i think it would be good for him in either environment he cannot come to my school b c he does not qualify financially through the state i work alongside a teacher who taught abeka in the private schools she said it is an excellent course up until about st grade because it is really strong in the phonics and focuses on getting the children to learn to read quickly after that she would recommend going to a more standard curriculum in nd abeka focuses on core curriculum recognizing letters and sounds led by teacher guidance and working out of a workbook but the children learn to blend letters and read quickly and at their own pace my son's class will also have center time and recess and other fun things but sections of the day are disjoint from other sections ie worktime from playtime thematic is more integrated learning it can be good but there is also a downside i have noticed many parents of smarter kids wanting me to push the reading and some children in class just aren't ready yet and it is harder to individualize learning with this type of curriculum we mainly focus on coloring cutting gluing learning letters and colors and shapes and numbers within the context of the theme we may have bear week and the children learn about bear habits and hibernation and get to bring their teddy bears all while learning about the letter b and the number for three bears they may play bear games and get to do bear crafts cutting coloring and gluing thematic learning is entertaining for the children but the advanced ones get held back if they already know the basics it is really up to you i would base it on where my kid was academically and pick the environment which you think is best so they have pros and cons i hope that helps  Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Japan Education in the United States Homeschooling No Child Left Behind Act Education in Taiwan Education Kindergarten A Course In Miracles Phonics Education in Germany Bah__'__ Faith and Education Sesame Street Education in Singapore Waldorf Education Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Secondary education in Japan Intelligent design movement Education in England Teach the Controversy Early childhood education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Law school Education in Albania JumpStart Education in Portugal Education in Australia Teacher Education in Romania Alexander Technique Education in Hong Kong Danish Folkeskole Education GED Dyslexia Independent school (UK) Miami-Dade County Public Schools Literacy Master's degree Experiential education Medical school McGuffey Readers Extreme Programming Suzuki method Separation of church and state Motion picture rating system Public education Far Eastern University Tripartite System Franklin W.

please suggest me some techniques to develop focus and balancing in preschool children also how to develop hand muscle for coloring and writing the best ways to do that for focus and balancing you can play some fun movement games such as 'musical statues' they have to focus on the music then be able to 'freeze' when the music stops you can incorporate balancing by giving them the pose they have to make when the music stops the above answer from leslie is also very good start with two masking tape lines on the floor not too far apart and the child has to walk between them then go to one masking tape line which the child walks along then to a low wide balance beam then a low narrower one then you can make it a higher wide balance beam then a higher narrow balance beam etc as far as developing hand muscle control you have to look at the 'whole child' they need to develop larger arm muscle control first so activities such as throwing balls dancing with scarves moving their arms in prewriting patterns in the air roller painting at an easel etc then move onto developing muscle control in the hands lots of manipulation with playdough squirting water spray bottles squeezing water from sponges etc then they need to be able to do isolated finger movements lots of fingerplays at group time ie where is thumbkin cutting with scissors picking up small objects using a pincer grasp squeezing pegs etc etc i have oodles of activities specifically designed to assist pre writing motor skill development in particular so if you would like more ideas please feel free to email me  Volleyball Aikido Professional wrestling holds Quake III Arena Drawing Swingout Glossary of partner dance terms Weight training Fast bowling Tag Equine conformation Paintball Textile manufacturing Diving Stage lighting Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Music Anchor Bass guitar Naruto jutsu Bicycle lighting BEAM robotics Menstrual cup Double bass Proprioception Harp Asperger syndrome Stuttering Professional wrestling throws Floppy disk Milton H.

how to handle crying child in pre school class room its been almost a month but one child still have not adjusted to pre school environment what should i do i am pre school teacher i think it's the worst when kids cry i taught kindergarten this past year and i had kids that off and on would cry one little girl cried often i talked to her and comforted her but nothing seemed to help at the suggestion of a co worker at the beginning of the year i talked to the child and told her every day for minutes she would be allowed to cry as much as she wanted at her desk i would set a timer after the minutes was up it was time to join kindergarten she did really well with that at first but then after christmas break that no longer worked so i talked to her mom and asked her mom to give the child a picture of herself that the child could carry around anytime the child felt sad or missed mom she was allowed to pull out the picture it worked for that situation the other child was much easier i had my aide take him out and read with him or play playdoh with him until he was calm she never talked to him about him crying she just was like let's go read and he would and he would calm down very fast and that extra attention always cheered him up the other thing you could do which i have never tried but sounds good would be to make up a little treat sheet and make sure the parents are involved and let's say the first week if the child cries only out of days he she gets a prize at school and at home then the next week you try for out of days for the prize if the student doesn't make his her goal there is no punishment but if he she makes his her goal there is a reward also the reward has to be something the child really likes like minutes on the computer or a handful of skittles or extra minutes of freetime whatever he she enjoys doing and would work towards getting that prize  Dog training Kodocha Kindergarten Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Contender (television series) Great Teacher Onizuka Shaggy dog story Avenue Q Hey Jude The Catcher in the Rye Recurring South Park characters Pitaten Recess (TV series) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Little Britain Scenes from a Memory About a Boy Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Malcolm in the Middle Teachers (film) Columbine High School massacre Social rule Friends Education in Romania Le Malade imaginaire The Adventures of Pete & Pete Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Miss Saigon Quizbowl Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China EastEnders GED Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide Drama Treehouse of Horror V The Inside The Amazing Race Code: Lyoko The Fairly OddParents The Amber Spyglass Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Family from One End Street Theory of conduct Sant Thakar Singh Time Out of Mind Football (soccer) Baby Blues Milton H.

am i being unreasonable with the daycare director my kids are in a daycare preschool and have been students there for the past two years they love it i like the teachers and the school it's convenient to where we live they offer an after school program as well so when my oldest starts kindergarten next month he'll be able to be bussed to the same center with the teachers and surroundings he knows and loves however we've had an issue with the director and my youngest son he was nearing four years old when he finally got fully potty trained no accidents ever they transferred him to the three year old classroom with the rest of the kids his age then transferred him back to the older toddler room until he got fully potty trained he got fully potty trained a few months ago but they haven't transferred him over yet saying at the end of august all the kids move up this means he'll only be one year behind instead of two which is just not good enough the director has been out of town for six weeks and supposedly no one can make the decision to move him with the kids his own age the child is starting kindergarten next year and is in the toddler room a full year older than his classmates am i being unreasonable to say that if they don't transfer him to the four year old class not the threes we're withdrawing our kids and putting him somewhere where he can be with kids his age and on his level he's perfectly happy but the classes are done differently the classroom he should be in has a more educational focus while the other is primarily playtime i've spoken with everyone at the school all i'm getting when i ask flat out to talk to the director is that she is aware of the situation and it takes everything in me to keep from yelling well big freakin deal it's a private daycare preschool he's supposed to start kindergarten in a year fall and he's currently in the older two's classroom he's so far behind a year moving him to the room with all the rest of his current classmates will mean he won't complete pre k the class that really focuses on getting them ready for k or he'll be held back a year he's happy where he is but more days than not the most educational thing he does is watch dora the explorer i really don't want to withdraw them they love it they have friends etc i'm just bothered by her lack of availability i can understand the delay most preschool rooms aren't equipped for diaper changing also a lot of places wait until certain dates to move kids that way groups of children move to the next room at the same time it helps with the transition if they move up with a buddy unlike moving up by themselves at thier birthday since they do it that way it probably means they would be out of ratio to move your son up early however in august they should bump him up two grades so to speak not just one  Kindergarten Education in the United States Education in Taiwan Education in Germany Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Kimberly-Clark Corporation Education in Romania Education in Australia Kodocha Recess (TV series) Education in Hong Kong Primary education Education in Portugal Columbine High School massacre Hikikomori GED Baby Blues Montessori method Caulfield Grammar School Shaggy dog story Social rule Boston Public Secondary education in Japan School Current teachings of Prem Rawat The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Early childhood education JumpStart Murdock-Portal Elementary School Avenue Q Grade (education) College Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Tripartite System The Ashlee Simpson Show Taipei American School Drama Rugrats Hopkins School The Fairly OddParents The Adventures of Pete & Pete Code: Lyoko Dalton McGuinty Laura Schlessinger Ben Johnson (athlete) Miss Saigon Autism Theory of conduct George Burns Scientology beliefs and practices Bilingual education Sesame Street Miami-Dade County Public Schools RuneScape quests Hillary Rodham Clinton Culture of the United States The Sims 2 Graduate school About a Boy The Sims The Karate Kid, Part III Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Education Alexander Technique The Catcher in the Rye Vegeta Education in South Korea Japanese tea ceremony Dog training Time Out of Mind British Rail Class 86 Gwinnett University Center Columbia University University of Virginia Tai Chi Chuan E.L.E.C.T.I.O.N.S.

i want some activities for kids age i am a teacher in a nuresery my kids are years i want a new good syllubus for them in english language could anyone help even by sites i remember in my primary school we had word cards and in our groups we had to put them together to make a sentance they were just printed out words on a paper which were then laminated we all used to love using them however i'm pretty sure we were a bit older than and lol maybe you could do the same thing with the childrens names to start off with one letter per sheet and they have to use the cards to make their names and then move on to other words as they progress another idea is to use 'magic sand' the children can practice their letters and names in a shallow tray of coloured sand using their fingers to write them perhaps you could write a class story not too long just sit them all down on the carpet and ask them what could happen next and try to encourage them to tell you word for word what to write down then they could draw pictures to go with it afterwards you could always make it about a certain character and each story could be about a day to day activity and you could keep them all in a kind of scrapbook you could always try reading them a short story but replacing one of the words with a nonsense word and asking them what they think it could actually say eg the cat 'strawberries' on the mat and encourage lots of suggestions i hope this helps sorry my suggestions aren't all that great i did try hehe good luck with whatever you decide to do  Yu-Gi-Oh!

why is it that only low income gets accepted into the public school pre k i went to sign my daughter up for pre k at the public school here in maryland and found out today that she wont be accepted due to the fact that they only take low income for the state funding there isnt a daycare that gives her the schooling that would be necessary because most of them are just babysitters not real teachers why is there nothing for the working parents i work my a off and pay taxes for what i want my children to have an education the lower incomes just want somewhere to take there kid now im not trying to be rude or judgemental but for the most part that is what is going on its not fair i did say that it is only most of the daycares that are just babysitters and yes i have seen some where they only hire young kids to watch the children if you have a degree then i wish you were here but around here its not like that i have wrote our governor on this issue and maybe it will ruffle a few feathers for someone to finally look at it all head start is only for the lower income when it comes to public schools if the prek is available it should be available for all funding public school pre k for all children would cost taxpayers a tremendous amount of money it's probably coming someday but the school districts need to pass their budget and if they add in that expense all at once the budget would probably get voted down if you want universal public school pre k talk to people in your district and talk to the district show them that there is support among the voters for the cost increase for this program in the meantime the public schools are doing pre k through state funding which is targeted to low income students because these students are typically lower achieving in the schools the idea is that they are already behind upon entering kindergarten so it is best for society as a whole if they are given a chance during pre k to catch up to where they should be i know it stinks that you need to pay for pre k for your child but that's the way it is for now for the reasons described above drum up voting support if you want it to change  No Child Left Behind Act Education in the United States Kindergarten Education in Japan Education in the People's Republic of China Dalton McGuinty School choice Tax Public education Day care Charter school Taxation in the United States Education in Hong Kong Martin J.

if you took your preschooler into a garden what is one thing he she would definitely notice hello most definitely ants and slaters we watch the ants pulling along pieces of food which far outweigh them the struggles they have and their little counterparts coming along to help them or giving little messages and going on their way looking at this world from the eyes of a toddler is probably as close as god watching us struggle and grow through life slaters rolling up in little balls to protect themselves from harm when they feel it is all clear they unroll and go on their way snails asleep in their shell when he is picked up he will slowly come out to take a look at what is happening to his world to see from the eyes of a child is awe inspiring watching a bud grow and unfold into a beautiful flower is another thing of inspiration so many things in the garden i thought the little grandaughter had been throwing the rocks out of the bird bath onto the ground until one morning we were having a cuppa waiting for the birds to come for their early morning drink and the crows showed up we soon saw who was doing the rock throwing so much beauty and so may things to do in the garden take care  The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shaggy dog story Ant Hera Ayyavazhi mythology Piccolo Junior Saga Tenshinhan Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Social rule Hemp Night (book) Jon Secada Simone Weil Spidey Super Stories Garfield Johnny Appleseed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Hyuga Hinata Diving Piccolo (Dragon Ball) Care Bears The Pilgrim's Progress Snail Miss Saigon RuneScape quests The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie The Legend of Zelda series enemies Hamster Spider Into the Woods Poker jargon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Naruto jutsu Humphrey Bogart Current teachings of Prem Rawat Sento Hun-Apu Roman eating and drinking Customs and etiquette of Japan Rugrats Evidence of evolution Motif of harmful sensation Time Out of Mind Father's Day (Doctor Who) Blood (computer game) Mario British hip hop Urinary incontinence Chicken Jam (TV series) The Flintstones Happy Tree Friends Tomato Oh My Goddess!

year old boy cannot write is this a cause for concern he can recognize the letters and numbers but tracing them is a chore also coloring within the lines in pictures nope he's not developmentally there yet this is normal sure some kids start writing and reading that young but it's pretty rare keep playing with him reading to him allowing him to scribble and minimize or eliminate tv time he'll be fine pushing a young child to do something they are not developmentally prepared for frustrating for the parent and child and takes time away from other things you could be doing together there are tons of books available with fun activities to do with toddlers and preschoolers or you can search online for free ideas most children who are ahead in the preschool years even out with their peers in elementary school there is a school of thought that you can sit your toddler down and drill them with flashcards to make them brilliant this theory is thought of as utter hogwash by most early education specialists as well as psychologists and neurologists when kids are forced to learn a new skill before they are developmentally ready it either disappears or is learned in a different part of the brain than it would be if they waited until they were ready reading is a prime example of this for example you could sit down with your year old for minutes a day for quite some time and teach them how to read a clock they would eventually get it if you did nto reinforce that skill it would be forgotten think of all of the wasted time that could have been spent on nature walks or reading stories together if you wait until that child is older it will take about minutes to explain how a clock is read it's not like the kid is going to need to keep track of his appointments at or years old i understand the desire to enhance your child's learning but all he really needs is a safe loving environment with stimulating toys and activities as well as plenty of downtime to relax and explore on his own to flourish to his full potential  Montessori method Autism Infantilism Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Second language acquisition Asperger syndrome Milton H.

why is preschool only offered in public school systems on a limited basis i recently learned that preschool is only offered for a limited number of children as opposed to being available to all year olds in the school district with children that are considered high risk priority why is early education considered more beneficial to children in this category also what is really meant by the labeling of high risk for these children high risk for what exactly in this case high risk means that due to family situations finances and mental behavioral issues the child may have being at risk for these factors may affect their development in the future for instance children who live in poverty have abusive family situations or have behaviors stemming from abuse neglect are at higher risk for learning difficulties in order to try to combat these negative forces school districts offer preschool programs to help these children get ready for school these programs sometimes called early start or head start offer not only academic curricula but also behavior management and teach social skills to the children who may otherwise not receive such instruction early education is considered important for these children as it gives them the benefit of social skills and academic skills that they may otherwise not get from home it is also for children with special needs such as learning disabilities that may need a head start  Education in the People's Republic of China Kindergarten Education Education in Japan Homeschooling No Child Left Behind Act Tripartite System Education in Singapore GED Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Miami-Dade County Public Schools Mental retardation Autism Chinese University of Hong Kong Infantilism Insurance Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Domestic violence Education in Hong Kong Graduate school Education in Australia Divorce Sex education Affirmative action Traumatic brain injury Psychology Down syndrome Motivation Eugenics College Economic inequality Education in Portugal Education in Sweden Life insurance Education in Albania Secondary education in Japan Community college Education in England Social psychology Hikikomori Health insurance Fairfax County Public Schools Medical school Master's degree Controversies in autism Pedophilia Montessori method Bipolar disorder Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus RISC Intelligence quotient Publicly funded medicine High school Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Bond Fathers' rights Law school Independent school (UK) Autism rights movement Poverty Stuttering RuneScape Waldorf Education Bah__'__ Faith and Education Extreme Programming Cephalic disorder Education reform Human sexual behavior Capitalism Nurse Stroke Drug abuse Education in Romania Education in the Republic of Ireland Social Security debate (United States) Psychosis Alzheimer's disease Child sexuality Martial art Multiple sclerosis Babson College Arturo Frondizi Gifted PLATO Learning North-American Interfraternity Conference Charter school Scientology beliefs and practices Schizophrenia Public education Far Eastern University

looking to start home day care in illinois i am wondering if i should go ahead and getting licensed or just babysit and claim taxes what are the pros cons to each option i have a degree in child development and experinces working at a naeyc accreddited center no more than kids looking to just supplement income you are generally not required to get a license if you are providing care for only a few children but i would strongly recommend it not only is it much easier to find clients if you are licensed but you have some protection in case of an accident the requirements to be licensed are generally minimal and most are basic safety precautions that would be wise to follow anyway there are many grants and support systems available for licensed daycare providers that are not available for babysitters check with your local resource and referral agency most areas have grants that pay you back for any charges that you incur while obtaining your daycare license and it is well worth the initial time investment to have i ran a home daycare for years and the majority of my clients were referred to me through the resource and referral agency because i was licensed it was far cheaper than any form of advertising i could have done if you need some information on marketing your business visit marketing a home based preschool http education preschoolrock com index php preschool resources for teachers marketing a home based preschool  Day care Education in the United States Education in Japan Child support X Window System Education in the People's Republic of China Insurance Social Security debate (United States) Publicly funded medicine Social work Dissociative identity disorder Ajax (programming) Identity theft Windows XP Nuclear power Linux Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Taxation in the United States Kindergarten Enterprise content management BitTorrent Real estate broker Common Unix Printing System Food and Drug Administration American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Novell NetWare Student loan Life insurance PHP MySQL Password Probation officer Microsoft Nuclear power phase-out Wget Mutual fund Client-server Windows Server 2003 Cable television OpenDocument XML Spam (electronic) McMartin preschool Pharmaceutical company Microsoft Office SCO-Linux controversies Motion picture rating system Btrieve Web crawler Lawyer Food Stamp Program Hillary Rodham Clinton Annuity FairTax Automatic number plate recognition National Health Service United Kingdom corporation tax MS-DOS Copyright Relationship marketing United States Postal Service Trademark Software patent debate Surveillance Security (finance) Accountancy Early childhood education History of Microsoft Windows Unemployment benefit Inflation Centrelink Domain Name System E-mail spam Education Medical prescription Open source culture Charter school Tax Advertising GNU General Public License Microsoft Windows Mozilla Firefox Education in Portugal Free software Gmail Auto insurance Public bodies and task forces of the UK government National Institutes of Health Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus No Child Left Behind Act Open Directory Project Copyleft
