would you continue the application process of a job if one of the interviewer completely disresrespected you i applied for this government job a year ago i recently had a nd interview for a background check the person who interviewed me mad me feel like an idiot she made fun of things that i wrote on the application told me how disappointed in me she was she doesn't even know me and made me feel like i should be kissing the ground she walked on because they were even still considering me as an applicant now am completely stressed out and not even sure i still want the job i shouldn't have to work with her much if at all once on the job the job would also be a much higher paying salary i am just afraid the way she treated me will effect my job performance if i do get the job like i will feel constantly on edge what do you think what would you do there are a few things to consider carefully before taking any action do you want that particular government job or you just want a better paying job if the job you interviewed for is really the one you want for various reasons then you should consider who would be your supervisor if it was a background check interview it's usually done by someone in human resources and unless that is the department you're going to work in you have nothing to worry about if you go ahead and take the job make sure you clear things with the person that made you feel bad use a calm tone and express your distress tell the person how her approach to your application and the things she said hurt you make sure you refer to her actions and don't label her for example don't say you are a mean person and you made me feel bad about myself but do say your behavior during the background check interview made me feel uncomfortable some of the things you said about my application like the fact that you were disappointed and you used humor in a serious and stressful context for me were really bothering me i just wanted to let you know how i felt about our meeting the point is to differentiate between the person and the behavior make sure she understands you don't resent her but you want her to be aware that her behavior hurt you a thing she might not be aware of about the thought you have on how her behavior would affect your performance clear the situation with the person it would help get rid of your feeling of inadequacy and then focus on doing your job right they wouldn't hire you if they weren't confident you could do the job the interviewer you feel bad about might have been stressed out herself had a bad day be new to the job or simply didn't have the skills to make you feel comfortable in the meeting don't take it to the heart because just like you said she doesn't even know you i can't say what i would do if i were you but if it was me in your situation and it was a job i wanted i'd go ahead and take the job deal with the interviewer's behavior and do my best i don't care much what other people think when they first meet me i care what they think after they know me and see what i can do alina  Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.

jobs for teens im and i need a new job cant work at bingo noone to babysit and i cant cut grass or anything what else is there here's a short list of jobs which you can create to generate income learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties birthday celebrations etc seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples a starter calligraphy kit usually runs around and anyone can easily pick up this skill the going rate is usually per hand addressed item become a poser who assists wedding photographers in setting and arranging various individuals in group and single photographic positions posers carry around a sketch book of various sitting and standing poses which consists of onion skin overlays of various wedding pictures bound in albums again contact local wedding photographers and wedding planners accordingly the hourly pay is around per hour and you are often invited to attend all dining activities seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting weed removal plant tree trimming light brush clearance you will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools again do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved a door to door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between to per hour offer policing removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process again a door to door solicitation of neighbors is in order you can charge between to per hour acquire a set of window cleaning tools a bucket liquid window cleaner sponge squeegee handle with an extension and a small step ladder and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services however be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story charge per window panel become a proxy stand in for neighbors to allow delivery of goods and packages to your home apartment acquire the authority to sign any receipt of incoming packages as an accepting neighbor charge per each package handled by you consider becoming a restaurant cafe customer liaison by using your cell phone at restaurants cafes to coordinate with the hostess to keep track of waiting customers whenever there's a very long period of time to activate a waiting list you want to offer the restaurant your services so that customers do not have to stand around for any lengthy period of time and when their name assigned number comes up you can call the upcoming customer's cell phone to tell them that they can return to the restaurant and be served the call back fee is usually around cents on a per head basis for example a couple would be charged while children under would not be charged placement of a plaque which outlines your fee schedule near the hostess station is sufficient to garner attention of prospective customers who will value your services since they can do other activities outside of the restaurant
