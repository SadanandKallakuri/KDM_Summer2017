question about capital gain from property and reinvesting it i have bought a builder flat years back which is still under construction as of today i am about to sell it off now i have following questions the difference in price will be a capital gain i heard if house has not been constructed yet it is considered as structure and profit is not capital gain if it is not a capital gain then what is my tax liability if it is capital gain then can i invest it in a property purchased by my family member father to get tax benefit capital gain on the land part will be long term gain taxed at at present rates gain attributable to the structurewill be short term if the building is sold prior to year from completion short term gains are taxed as ordinary income so the rate would be the marginal rate for your income prior to the gain income crossing into a higher bracket will be taxed at the higher rate only for the income that exceeds the threshhold for that bracket you can defer the gain by using what's known as a exchange the rules for that are complicated but the basics are that the purchased property must be of the same character as the property sold the from the sale cannot come into possession of the seller must go to a exchange escrow and be held until the replacement property is bought and the replacement property must be identified within days and closed within days of the sale of the first property  Tax Microeconomics Mutual fund Capital gains tax FairTax Progressive tax Surplus value United Kingdom corporation tax Insurance Capitalism Life insurance Gross domestic product Security (finance) Annuity Mortgage Taxation in the United States Leasing Supply and demand Short selling Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 Flat tax Dividend Capital accumulation Labor theory of value 401(k) Bond Supply-side economics Income tax Anarchism and capitalism Futures contract Monetary policy Islamic banking Free trade Economics Day trading Hyperinflation Intellectual property Commodity Economy of Russia Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Productive and unproductive labour Wealth Investment bank Privatization Arbitrage Margin (finance) Bretton Woods system Value added tax Corporate finance Gold standard Estoppel Inflation Monopoly (game) Warranty Temasek Holdings Economic rent Money Debt Article One of the United States Constitution Price discrimination Property tax Hedge fund Real estate bubble Manitoba Hydro Dividend imputation Gold as an investment Lloyd's of London Stock Prices of production Advertising Airline First-sale doctrine Trust (Law) USA MMORPG Government debt Derivative (finance) Mobile home Stamp duty Warren Buffett Tax bracket Real estate economics Property (ownership right) Taxation in the Republic of Ireland Personal finance Profit Foreign exchange market Regressive tax Trickle down effect Tax cut Cost of capital
