are workshops good for people with down s syndrome while it is important that schools set educational goals for students with disabilities that are of equal value to other students' goals many other factors contribute to successful learning and ultimately a successful transition to a life after school expanding transition and postsecondary opportunities for people with down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities has been of great interest to many for the past decade studies have shown students with intellectual disabilities including down syndrome that participate in postsecondary education are more likely to excel in academics employment and life many children with down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities are now being included k and want to pursue postsecondary education like their peers and siblings a request for proposal rfp was developed and distributed in february to all two and four year public and private colleges in new jersey with the rfp the schools applied for funds for a planning year to develop the program based on the criteria established by the steering committee upon successful completion of the planning year the college would be eligible for additional funding for the first and second operational years of the program with the understanding that following the second year the program must be self sustaining for centuries people with down syndrome have been alluded to in art literature and science it wasn't until the late th century however that john langdon down an english physician published an accurate description of a person with down syndrome it was this scholarly work published in which earned down the recognition as the father of the syndrome although others had previously recognized the characteristics of the syndrome it was down who described the condition as a distinct and separate entity throughout the th century advances in medicine and science enabled researchers to investigate the characteristics of people with down syndrome in the french physician jerome lejeune identified down syndrome as a chromosomal anomaly when he observed chromosomes present in each cell of individuals with down syndrome instead of the usual it was later determined that an extra partial or complete st chromosome results in the characteristics associated with down syndrome down syndrome occurs in one out of every live births and more than people in the u s have this genetic condition one of the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormalities down syndrome affects people of all ages races and economic levels today individuals with down syndrome are active participants in the educational vocational social and recreational aspects of our communities in fact there are more opportunities than ever before for individuals with down syndrome to develop their abilities discover their talents and realize their dreams for example more teens and adults with down syndrome each year are graduating from high school going to college finding employment and living independently the opportunities currently available to individuals with down syndrome have never been greater however it is only through the collective efforts of parents professionals and concerned citizens that acceptance is becoming even more widespread it is the mission of the national down syndrome society to ensure that all people with down syndrome are provided the opportunity to achieve their full potential in all aspects of their lives as for workshops places people with disabilities learn job life skills are helpful if you can teach

if someone is blind and deaf from birth do they know anything do they understand what they are what other people are or what existence is yes they understand what they are from feeling hunger and sleepiness they feel emotions just like everyone else i know because deafblind people feel intense feelings of frusteration from not being able to communicate or navigate in fact deafblind people even think like humans do however they cannot think visually or linguistically so they think cerebrally this is a universal way of thinking that is thought in the purest form their existence is limited to touch they can feel doorknobs and over time learn that there are rooms inside those doorknobs they learn to grasp forks like everyone else to flush a toilet to run and skip they still have the gift of movement movement is their way of expressing their thoughts and feelings while touch is their way of getting to know the world eventually they also become aware of the dangers they cannot see or hear that must be more frightening than anything imagine the shock of a dog sinking its teeth into your arm without seeing or hearing it you only feel the pain of your punctured flesh and the shock of what happened so yes this is another form of existence deafblind people might not ever be one hundred percent able to know what existence really is without having sight and hearing however they do know that there is a world with people and all kinds of things and ideas in it it just takes them longer to learn it they have a different perception but they still have a perception deafblind people eventually learn that there is a big wide world out there with color shapes sounds etc they learn about sounds from vibrations they learn communication techniques by learning braille sign language and finger spelling this enables them to communicate with others and as their vocabulary progresses they learn more and more ideas to build a better picture of what the world is really like to better understand what it is like to be deaf and blind maybe one day you should try putting on a pair of earmuffs and a blindfold  Deafblindness Milton H.

cochlear implant question for deaf teens or adults i'm unsure if i will receive any answers but here is my questions anyways i have an year old profoundly deaf student was implanted at the age of in with a recommendation to not implant surgery went ahead anyways the implant has never really worked well for my student he has the outdated advanced bionics ci parents do not bring my student in for updates or mapping my question is there is an update for the advanced bionics ci and wondering if any deaf teens or adults have had success with this updated ci i'm going to push for this update this year when i meet with his parents again in a few weeks the prior answerer is incorrect when saying that cis work only of the time if this were true they would not be fda approved the failure rate of cochlear implants are less than i don't understand how the parents got the surgery done when the implant team recommended against it that's very difficult to do if the implant has not worked for your student it probably has been due to difficulties such as poor family support and lack of training rather than a device failure you don't just put an implant on and all of a sudden a person knows how to do it there is a specific auditory rehabilitation process that must be followed or the wearer often cannot use it properly this is why going through candidacy has many aspects and is hard to find someone to do it if the team recommends against it your question is very difficult to answer without knowing either the internal component or external component of the implant internal pieces are made to be able to be updated with future technology you 'update' the external piece not the internal piece changing the internal peice would mean they would have to go back in surgery which could be risky however the external peice could be updated but if the student is not using the one he has properly an updated exernal peice will not help instead of pushing for a new peice push for more services for the child this child should have an iep and needs av therapy auditory verbal speech therapy and an oral teacher of the deaf these services if provided can be done at school the iep should also incude a complete audiological evaluation yearly which takes the cost off the parents which may be the reason they are hesitant to keep up with the implant this would help the child much more than trying to get the parents to pay for an expensive upgrade to equipment they obviously don't facilitate to begin with please email me if you have any questions sorry for the spelling spell check isn't working  Glossary of medical terms related to communications disorders Prostate cancer Medicine Scientology beliefs and practices Second language acquisition Education in the People's Republic of China Infantilism Growth hormone treatment Stuttering Special education Education Dyslexia Aphasia Hearing aid Abortion Condom Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Food and Drug Administration Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Transsexuality Urinary incontinence Divorce Models of deafness Education in the United States No Child Left Behind Act Graduate school Windows 2000 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma RFID Androgen insensitivity syndrome Tai Chi Chuan Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Controversies in autism Motion picture rating system Antiretroviral drug Milton H.
