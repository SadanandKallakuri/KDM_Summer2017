this is for employers only is it good to is it good for a potential employee to send a thank you letter after an interview does it sway your decision to hire them at all for instance if you interview two people with the same qualifications and skill level and one send a thank you letter and the other doesn't whom are you more likely to hire also does it seem to desperate or you find it flattering i'm asking because i interviewed for a position that was my dream job i sent them a thank you letter to let them know that i appreciated the opportunity to interview i don't want to necessarily sway them but i want them to know that i am really interested and would work really hard for them i am hoping that they will see that i am sincere and really want the opportunity to show them what i can do is that bad when i went on the interview i know i sold myself but since i know that they probaly conducted many interviews i thought that writing them a thank you would put a fresh mark in their minds that i am still out there they told me i was at the top of their list i'm sure they haven't forgotten i just wanted to be nice and say thank you i was truly blessed to even have the opportunity to interview for these people as an employer a thank you note would be a nice touch if i had two or three people running close for the position and one sent a thank you note i wouldn't say it would make me hire them but it would make me keep them in the front of mind just because like you said its a little reminder of who you are good luck to you  New York Giants Time Out of Mind Theory of conduct Social rule Milton H.

when interviewing avoid talking salary but what if they really persist help i'm perplexed i keep coming across employers who really try to screen me out right away on the salary part they want to know how much am i looking for and when i try to avoid the question at all costs as the numerous books and jobs boards say to do these employers get really pushy about it to the point where they may raise their voice or totally stop the interview till i answer ofcourse i explain it depends on the position i'm negotiable i try to turn the tables by saying are you offering me the job it's like pulling my teeth then when i do say an amount sometimes i am in the range of what they were going to pay sometimes other times i am way to high which i am not but this whole process seems to leave a bad atmosphere after wards what am i supposed to think do or say about this just blab the wages first time they ask if the employer asks you about what you expect for pay then they have opened the door for you to answer it's not inappropriate to answer when this happens however you should not be the one to ask about the pay first actually when you put up such a defense when the employer asks the question regarding pay it really makes you look like you are hard to get along with and would not be able to work well with others  Social rule Inflation Labor theory of value Efficiency wages Microeconomics The Doctor Dances Blackjack Economic inequality National Kidney Foundation Singapore Poker jargon Plame affair Extreme Programming Salary Wheel of Fortune Minimum wage 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Economics $ale of the Century Tax Game programmer Social Security (United States) GNU General Public License G-Man (Half-Life) Graduate school Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Unemployment Labour economics Monetary policy Expert system Health insurance Keynesian economics Mutual fund Employment The Parting of the Ways Labor-power Flat tax Capitalism Swedish allotment system Student loan Wage Rick Santorum Principal-agent problem Division of labour Surplus labour Outsourcing Professor The Princeton Review Rent (musical) Unemployment benefit Taxation in the United States Drug test Insurance Progressive tax The Time Machine Steve Jobs Trade union Compensation of employees Slot machine ACORN 401(k) The Joker's Wild Bad Wolf Credit card Call centre Working time Interview Salary cap Alan Keyes Theory of the firm Little Britain Avenue Q Warren Buffett 2004 U.S. election voting controversies, Ohio The Shining (film) Supply and demand Air traffic controller Freeters Anarchism and capitalism Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Glen Jacobs GED Software engineering Volleyball The nature of God in Western theology Offshoring Carl Barks I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue British House of Commons God Emperor of Dune Publicly funded medicine James Randi Gas metal arc welding Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Tariff Conscription SAT SCO-Linux controversies Betting (poker)

does anyone know of a good resume writing site seeking employment looking for a professional resume writing company that is affordable and does great work there seem to be a lot online just not sure which one is the best for me any help will be appreciated besides setting all margins to the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text is scanability here are some helpful tips place just below your identification header your hame address phone email address any conditional warning statement such as confidential resume do not contact current employer etc always fill in an objectives category just below the conditional warning statement and make sure that he objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer select a mono type font such as helvetica arial courier or times roman do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned keep font sizes within a range of to pts avoid styling text with a justified alignment keep it flushed left instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly do not place an i d picture anywhere on the resume this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues do not place any graphic text saved as gifs onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase list at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences language skills social interactions such as golf team sports tennis etc in conclusion the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into pdf which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer if the original resume was created in word wordperfect or mac appleworks it can be saved as a pdf file which then can be saved as an email attachment otherwise you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a pdf file failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries good luck  Typeface Killian documents Portable Document Format Gmail HTML element EIA-708 TrueType Computer virus CPU cache OpenDocument Apple typography Ebook Google PostScript WordPerfect ALGOL 68 E-mail spam Enterprise content management Opera (web browser) Apple Macintosh Stopping e-mail abuse Cyrillic alphabet HTML ASCII art Python programming language Cascading Style Sheets Virtual memory Windows 2000 E-mail Windows Vista PNG Perl Computer Pretty Good Privacy Plame affair Atari 8-bit family Forth programming language Windows XP IPod Macromedia Flash Emacs Phishing Magnetic resonance imaging British national identity card System/36 Microsoft Apple Computer Blog Screenshot Palanca Awards File Allocation Table Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Euro Password SCO-Linux controversies Stuttering Arabic alphabet Icon programming language Optical character recognition Anonymous remailer Medical prescription Digital photography Dot matrix printer Intellectual property Objective-C Hangul Musical Instrument Digital Interface Geographic information system Compiler optimization Volleyball Logo programming language File format Mach kernel Chinese character Requirements analysis REBOL Business continuity planning Computer and video game genres Hello world program Human sexual behavior Infantilism Shogi Computer forensics Screenwriting Autism Tennis Typewriter Microeconomics United Kingdom corporation tax HyperCard AmigaOS Web design

did i open pandora's box i have always worn pantyhose with my skirt suits for work each day at the office needless to say with me dressing that way my hubby developed a pretty intense curiousity about it as i was getting ready for work one day i asked him what the fascination was and he told me that he found it alluring and sensual when i wear pantyhose and that he was curious to experience that feeling so i hiked up my skirt eased out of my sheers handed them to him and told him to slip them on i let him keep them on for a few minutes and he went absolutely crazy over the way they felt which i thought was kind of neat now hes asked a few more times recently for me to let him wear them again i don't want to deny it to him because of how fascinated he is and how much he liked it that one time i'm thinking if i can limit it to a few minutes around the time we go to bed we could have fun with it was i wrong to do this how should i handle this it's maybe a little bit kinky but definitely not wrong as long as it doesn't really bother you don't worry about it after all nobody else has to know if that's your concern if you and he end up having some fun with it so much the better there's nothing wrong with it  Milton H.
